# Website for a restaurant

Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4

In this project I learned about:
- Grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components.
- CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass.
- The basics of Node.js and NPM and task runners like Grunt and Gulp.

With this project I was able to:
- Set up, design and style a web page using Bootstrap 4 and its components.
- Create a responsive web page design.
- Make use of web tools to setup and manage web sites.
